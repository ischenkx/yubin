### How to run?

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Go and Docker Compose

#### ViewStat

ViewStat is a plugin that checks whether an email was viewed by a recipient.

How to set up?
1. Get some Redis server (probably you can use a free plan on RedisLabs)
2. Run ```cmd/viewstat/main.go``` somewhere (Heroku?)
3. Provide the redis client information and a link to the viewstat server in config

#### Yubin

1. Fix config (provide correct database information)
2. Install Go and Docker (Compose)
3. Run `bash ./docker-boot.sh`

Now you can interact with Yubin via a REST api (check out docs in ```internal/api/rest```)!
